#E-commerce

E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It encompasses a wide range of online activities, including online shopping, electronic payments, and digital storefronts. E-commerce has transformed traditional retail by enabling businesses to reach a global audience, streamline transactions, and provide convenient shopping experiences for consumers. It involves various models such as business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions.
